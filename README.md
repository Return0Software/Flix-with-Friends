# Flix with Friends

Developed by [Joseph Martinsen](https://github.com/JosephMart) and [Tristan Partin](https://github.com/tristan957)

Flix with Friends is a program that helps users decide what movie they should watch. It reads
through spreadsheets or Google Sheets that have names of movies that users would like to watch.
The program searches through a movie database to pull descriptions, ratings and various poster
sizes to present in an IMDb-like interface to help users decide on what movie to watch based on
search criteria like keywords, release date, rating and which of the users has seen the movie.
